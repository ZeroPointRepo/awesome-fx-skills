// Named marker scoping. One contract, one implementation.
//
// Every generator in this repository that reads or rewrites a region of README.md locates that
// region by a NAMED MARKER PAIR (`<!-- catalog:start -->` .. `<!-- catalog:end -->`), never by
// walking from one heading to the next.
//
// Why this file exists. The scripts here used to scope by heading range —
// `text.indexOf('## fx skills') .. text.indexOf('## fx MCP servers')` — and they fell back to the
// WHOLE README when either heading moved. That combination is the auxiliary-section
// denominator-inflation bug: rename a heading and the entry parser silently swallows the MCP
// servers, the gateways, the ports section and every accordion below, so the count goes up, the
// badge goes up, and nothing anywhere reports a fault. A named marker cannot drift onto content
// it was not put around, and a missing one is a hard stop rather than a wider net.
//
// Rules, and they are the point of the module:
//   * A missing marker ABORTS. It never widens to the whole file and never returns empty. A
//     generator that cannot find its boundaries has no business guessing them.
//   * A DUPLICATED start marker aborts too. Two copies silently truncate the region at the second
//     one, which is the same class of failure wearing different clothes.
//   * `replaceRegion` preserves the indentation in front of the start marker onto the end marker,
//     so a block nested inside a list item does not creep left a little on every run.

const startTag = (name) => `<!-- ${name}:start -->`;
const endTag = (name) => `<!-- ${name}:end -->`;
